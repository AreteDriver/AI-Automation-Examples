AI / Automation work examples.
# AI-Install-QA 🚗🔧

Prototype repo to showcase **AI-driven install QA** using AR glasses, optimization algorithms, and automation.  
This project is structured as a technical demo for recruiters and teams interested in applied AI, lean manufacturing, and workflow optimization.

## 📖 Concept

- **AR Guidance:** AR glasses walk team members through install tasks step by step.  
- **Vehicle Access:** VIN scan + visual walkaround required before vehicle unlocks.  
- **Process Enforcement:** Install steps, torque specs, and parts usage are confirmed in real-time.  
- **SOP Validation:** Each step requires a digital sign-off, ensuring compliance.  
- **QA Drive Cycle:** Units are validated with a short drive cycle before release.  
- **Scheduling:** Install bays are assigned using optimization (OR-Tools).
